## üìã Requirements

- **FiveM Server** - ESX, QBCore, or standalone
- **oxmysql** - For database operations (if using MySQL)
- **MySQL Database** - For persistent storage (optional)
- **Discord Webhook** - For notifications (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Download and Extract
```bash
# Download the resource
git clone https://github.com/Dev-NotAqua/FivemAC.git
cd FivemAC

# Copy to your resources folder
cp -r resources/fivem-ac /path/to/your/server/resources/
```

### 2. Database Setup (Optional)

If you want persistent storage, create a MySQL database and configure the connection:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE fivemac;
```

The tables will be created automatically on first run.

### 3. Configuration

Edit `resources/fivem-ac/config.json`:

```json
{
    "discord": {
        "enabled": true,
        "webhook": "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"
    },
    "database": {
        "enabled": true,
        "connectionString": "mysql://username:password@localhost/fivemac"
    }
}
```

### 4. Server Configuration

Add to your `server.cfg`:

```bash
# Ensure oxmysql is started first (if using database)
ensure oxmysql

# Start FivemAC
ensure fivem-ac
```

### 5. Permissions

Add admin permissions to your `server.cfg`:

```bash
# Give admin access to FivemAC
add_ace group.admin fivemac.admin allow
add_principal identifier.license:YOUR_LICENSE_HERE group.admin
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Admin Commands

- `/acban <player_id> <reason>` - Permanently ban a player
- `/acscore <player_id>` - Check a player's current score

### Admin Panel

Access the admin panel in-game with the appropriate permissions:

1. **Players Tab** - View connected players, scores, and risk levels
2. **Logs Tab** - Browse detection events with filtering options
3. **Settings Tab** - Adjust thresholds and system settings

### Client Events

The system automatically monitors players and sends events to the server when suspicious activity is detected.

## üîß API Reference

### Server Events

#### `FivemAC:Flag`
Triggered when the client detects suspicious activity.

```lua
-- Example event data
{
    type = "aimbot",
    playerId = 1,
    playerName = "PlayerName",
    data = {
        avgAngleChange = 25.5,
        distance = 150.0,
        threshold = 15.0
    },
    severity = 85,
    timestamp = 1234567890
}
```

### NUI Callbacks

#### `getPlayers`
Returns list of connected players with scores.

#### `getLogs`
Returns filtered event logs.

#### `banPlayer`
Bans a player with specified reason and duration.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **Client-side validation** with server-side verification
- **Encrypted communication** between client and server
- **Rate limiting** to prevent spam
- **Performance optimization** with sampling rates
- **False positive mitigation** with intelligent thresholds

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Resource not starting:**
- Check that oxmysql is installed and started first
- Verify the resource name matches exactly: `fivem-ac`
- Check server console for error messages

**Database connection failed:**
- Verify MySQL credentials in config.json
- Ensure the database exists and is accessible
- Check oxmysql resource is properly configured

**Discord notifications not working:**
- Verify webhook URL is correct and active
- Check Discord server permissions
- Ensure webhook has permission to send embeds

**Admin panel not opening:**
- Verify player has `fivemac.admin` permission
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure NUI is enabled in FiveM settings

### Performance Optimization

For high-player-count servers:

```json
{
    "general": {
        "performanceMode": true
    },
    "detection": {
        "aimbot": {
            "samplingRate": 0.05
        }
    }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This anti-cheat system is designed to deter casual cheaters. Determined attackers may find ways around any detection system. Always keep your server and resources updated.

**üí° Tip:** Start with lower thresholds and gradually increase them based on your server's needs and false positive rates.
